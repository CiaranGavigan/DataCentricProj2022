# DataCentricProj2022
The proj was working up untill I added the mongo code and then I got errors comming from the express modules 
and it broke the app and after hours of trying to fix it before the deadline ive just given up I have no clue how to fix it 
The edit employee mysql function also caused one of these errors but it was not as bad as the mongo error as it only crashed the app if it was called
